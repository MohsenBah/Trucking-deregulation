This project mainly summarizes the model selection, statistical analysis and model diagnostics associated withthe Effect of Trucking Deregulation. In this project, we would like to analyze whether state deregulation could have a profound impact on the supply price charged per ton-mile. In the early 1980s, the Staggers Rail Act of largely ended almost a century of government regulation of railroads in the United States. Several states did remove regulatory constraints on the rate charged for intrastate trucking services. Railroads were given more rate flexibility and managerial control over their operations, and both intermodal and intramodal competitiveness were increased. 

In these variables, the factor which we are the most interested in is the state deregulation. In the article “Trucking Deregulation” by Thomas Gale Moore, studies showed that regulation increased costs and rates significantly. As judged by shippers, not only were rates lower without regulation, but also service quality was better. However, we did not know the true relationship between the trucking deregulation and the price. We can analyze 134 shipments to largely access their relationship.
  
  
We plan to set up a full model which has all possible explanatory variables of second order regression model with two quantitative variables and two qualitative ones (i.e. the linear component, quadratic component and the cross product or interaction component.) Finally, we created the model successfully by applying “forward selection”, “backward elimination” and “hybrid method” and comparing residual assumptions by various plots.
